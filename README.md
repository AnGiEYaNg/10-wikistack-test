For this workshop, we will be using the mocha.js testing framework with chai.js for assertions. We will be writing our tests just like any other node code, only instead of building features, we'll be building tests that probe those features.

Our testing suite will give us the tools we need for this task. We can:

- Categorize or group tests (using describe)
- Set up common code or data across different tests (using beforeEach)
- Declare an individual test (using it)
- Assert (i.e. confirm or deny) results within a test (using expect)
